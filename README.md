# Sorting_in_cpp


## Aim
To implement and understand various sorting algorithms using C++, analyze their time and space complexities, and compare their performance based on different input sizes.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the working of popular sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
- Implement these algorithms in C++.  
- Analyze and compare their **time and space complexity**.  
- Visualize sorting mechanisms using **flowcharts**.  
- Construct tables for performance comparison.  

---

## Theory
**Sorting** is the process of arranging data in a particular order (ascending or descending).  
Efficient sorting is crucial because it directly affects the performance of other algorithms like **searching** and **merging**.

Sorting algorithms can be classified based on:  
- **Time Complexity:** Best, Average, Worst case  
- **Space Complexity**  
- **Stability:** Whether relative order of equal elements is maintained  
- **Method:** Comparison-based or Non-comparison-based

## Sorting Algorithms Overview

| Algorithm       | Time Complexity (Worst) | Stability  | Method             |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------|--------------------|
| **Bubble Sort** | O(n²)                   | Stable     | Comparison-based   |
| **Selection Sort** | O(n²)                | Unstable   | Comparison-based   |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n²)                | Stable     | Comparison-based   |
| **Merge Sort**  | O(n log n)              | Stable     | Divide & Conquer   |
| **Quick Sort**  | O(n²) (Avg O(n log n))  | Unstable   | Divide & Conquer   |

## Algorithm Descriptions

### 1. Bubble Sort (Stable, O(n²))
- Repeatedly compares adjacent elements.  
- Swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
- Continues until the array is sorted.  

---

### 2. Insertion Sort (Stable, O(n²))
- Builds the sorted list one element at a time.  
- Inserts each element into its correct position.  

---

### 3. Selection Sort (Unstable, O(n²))
- Finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion.  
- Places it at the beginning.  

---

### 4. Merge Sort (Stable, O(n log n))
- Divide-and-conquer approach.  
- Recursively splits the array into halves.  
- Sorts them and merges back.  

---

### 5. Quick Sort (Unstable, O(n²), Avg O(n log n))
- Divide-and-conquer approach.  
- Selects a pivot and partitions the array.  
- Recursively sorts partitions.

## Time & Space Complexity Table (Quick Sort Example)

| Case        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Best**    | O(n log n)      | O(log n)         |
| **Average** | O(n log n)      | O(log n)         |
| **Worst**   | O(n²)           | O(log n)         |

## Conclusion  

Through this project, we have successfully implemented and compared multiple sorting algorithms in C++. From the experiments and analysis, the following observations were made:  

1. **Simple algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort)**  
   - Easy to implement and understand.  
   - Inefficient for large datasets due to their **O(n²) time complexity**.  

2. **Efficient algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)**  
   - Perform significantly better on large datasets, achieving **O(n log n)** in average/best cases.  

3. **Quick Sort**  
   - Often outperforms Merge Sort in practice due to **in-place sorting** and lower constant factors.  
   - Suffers from a **worst-case complexity of O(n²)**.  

4. **Merge Sort**  
   - Guarantees **O(n log n)** performance regardless of input.  
   - Stable and well-suited for cases where element order matters or when sorting linked lists.  

### Final Remark  
The choice of sorting algorithm depends on the dataset size, stability requirements, and memory constraints.  
- For **small datasets**, simpler algorithms may suffice.  
- For **large datasets**, Merge Sort or Quick Sort is preferable.
